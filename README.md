# MATH3332 Data Analytic Tools
While machine learning has seen many success stories, and software is readily available to design and train rich and flexible machine learning systems, we believe that the mathematical foundations of machine learning are important in order to understand the fundamental principles upon which more complicated machine learning systems are built. This course covered some of the important mathematical analysis tools for machine learning/data analysis. It was taught by [Professor YE. Guibo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=guibo-ye-magbye) during Spring 2022 at HKUST. She writes note for us in class. Her notes are clean and concise, and has been the major references for my LaTeX project. 

I have made my notes available for everyone to download, but I didn't typeset everything (parts of it is too workload heavy, so instead, I have uploaded the screenshot of the written notes out of frustration), so please bear with me. Also, if you do spot any typo/error, please do reach out to me at ymaung@ust.hk.
