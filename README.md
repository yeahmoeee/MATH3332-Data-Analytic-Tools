# MATH3332 Data Analytic Tools
While machine learning has seen many success stories, and software is readily available to design and train rich and flexible machine learning systems, we believe that the mathematical foundations of machine learning are important in order to understand the fundamental principles upon which more complicated machine learning systems are built. This course covered some of the important mathematical analysis tools for machine learning/data analysis. It is currently taught at HKUST by [Professor YE. Guibo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=guibo-ye-magbye). She writes note for us in class. Her notes are clean and concise. It is the major references for my Latex project. I am doing all this simply because I wanted to practice my Latex skills. (nothing else)

I have made my notes available for everyone to download, but I am very unlikely to include case studies, as it is very difficult to typeset every symbols in Latex, so please bear with me. Also, if you do spot any typo/error, please do reach out to me at ymaung@connect.ust.hk. 

I will be updating this repo once in a while. (preferably once a week) 

There is no guarantee that I will be typesetting til the end of the semester. (for obvious reasons)
